 <h2><b><u>Tarte Tatin</u></b></h2>
 <p>Mom's favorite and a French classic. An absolute pain to bake but trust me, <b>it's worth it</b><br>
    Did you know it was invented by accident when the owners of the Tatin hotel realized they were baking a pie without the crust and added it on top?<br>
    They then flipped it and the result  is gorgeous.
